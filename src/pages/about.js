            <b>{occupation}</b> discovering the ways of the code. Iâ€™m passionate about technology, 
            software architecture, research, and innovation. 
            Always looking for new challenges that keep my mind working and push the boundaries of my knowledge and experience, 
            I have worked on many different projects. From pure backend with millions of RPMs to carefully designed performant frontends, 
            and on monolithic apps, libraries, and microservices. 
            Iâ€™m interested in performance, code quality (Clean Code fan ðŸ˜›), scalable and clean architectural solutions.
          </p>
          <p className="i-5">Also, since 2018 I have been part of ORT Uruguay universityâ€™s teaching staff. 
            I have been in charge of teaching both theoretical and practical subjects. 
            For example, in Programming 1, I give the students the first approach to programming from scratch by teaching the theoretical concepts and 
            then I help them apply that to a particular language (Javascript); 
            in Programming 2, the focus is on software design quality, 
            and we see in more detail object-oriented programming (we see it in Java). 
            And finally, Programming for Biotechnology is also the first approach to programming but targeted to a profile that needs more problem solving through programming 
            and we focus rather on scripting. 
            Having the opportunity to work at the same university where I got my degree has been a very rewarding and 
            enriching experience and something I enjoy doing.</p>
          <p className="i-5">
            In my spare time, I like to play videogames, watch Netflix, try some new tech/framework/cool thing and read about cars.
